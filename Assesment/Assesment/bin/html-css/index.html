        <h1>Welcome to Joget!</h1>
        <p>
          Joget, Inc. is the developer and manager of the Joget DX commercial
          open source project, a no-code/low-code web platform that modernizes
          application development and workflow automation on the cloud and
          mobile. Joget DX is the next generation successor to Joget Workflow.
          From Workflow to Digital Transformation (DX), the product name change
          reflects the complete digital transformation capabilities offered by
          the platform

        <h1>Citizen Developer</h1>
        <p>
          Recognizing the needs of these users and customers, what Gartner had
          called "Citizen Developers" in 2012, Joget decidedly adopted the
          mantra "Codeless or Code Less" as the guiding vision in developing the
          Joget platform. In that same year, a brand new version was released
          that catered to non-coders to easily build apps or automate workflows
          all using a drag-and-drop, configurable approach to app development;
          and at the same time catered to coders, who may want to integrate with
          other systems or extend the platform with new custom features.
        </p>

        <h1>No-Code/Low-Code</h1>
        <p>
          In 2014, Forrester published a paper that recognized a new segment in
          the web app development space and coined the term "low-code platform",
          which evolved in the last couple of years into a "no-code/low-Code"
          platform space. Joget has been a pioneer in this space with our
          "Codeless or Code less" approach to web application development and
          process automation for the coders as well as non-coders
